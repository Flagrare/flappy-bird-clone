# FBird

FBird is the most generic copy of FlappyBird ever created for Unity.
It was part of Indie Game Academy level 0.

It has:

- Object collision;
- Score tracking;
- Game reset;

The main skill developed was the capacity to assemble resources and use Unity UI.

The game is playable and was published in [itch.io](https://flagrare.itch.io/most-generic-flappy-bird-ever)
